Title: Gnocchi di Patate (Potato Gnocchi) Recipe
Gnocchi di Patate are soft, pillowy Italian potato dumplings that melt in your mouth. Typically served with a variety of sauces, like butter and sage, or a rich tomato sauce, these homemade gnocchi are a true Italian comfort food.

Ingredients:
Potatoes - 500g (waxy potatoes like Yukon Gold work best)
All-purpose flour - 150g (about 1 1/4 cups)
Egg - 1, lightly beaten
Salt - 1 tsp
Nutmeg - a pinch (optional)
Olive oil or butter - for serving (optional)
Parmesan cheese - grated, for serving

Instructions:
Cook the Potatoes:

Place the potatoes in a pot of cold, salted water and bring to a boil.
Cook for about 20-30 minutes, until the potatoes are fork-tender.
Drain the potatoes, let them cool slightly, and then peel them while they are still warm.
Mash the Potatoes:

Mash the potatoes using a potato masher or pass them through a potato ricer to get a smooth texture. Let the mashed potatoes cool slightly.
Make the Dough:

On a clean surface, spread out the mashed potatoes and sprinkle with flour, salt, and a pinch of nutmeg (if using).
Make a well in the center and crack the egg into the well.
Gently combine the ingredients, kneading the dough until smooth and slightly sticky. Add more flour if the dough is too wet, but be careful not to add too much as it can make the gnocchi dense.
Form the Gnocchi:

Divide the dough into 4 portions. Roll each portion into a long log about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) thick.
Cut the logs into small pieces, about 1-inch long (2.5 cm).
To shape the gnocchi, you can use a fork to create the signature ridges by pressing each piece lightly with the back of the fork and rolling it off, or use a gnocchi board if you have one.
Cook the Gnocchi:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Gently drop the gnocchi into the boiling water in batches. They will sink to the bottom and then rise to the surface when they're done (about 2-3 minutes).
Use a slotted spoon to remove the gnocchi and place them on a plate.
Serve:

Serve the gnocchi hot with your favorite sauce, such as a simple butter and sage sauce, tomato sauce, or pesto.
Top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
Serve:
Gnocchi di Patate are incredibly versatile, so feel free to pair them with a variety of sauces. Theyâ€™re perfect for a cozy dinner, and the soft, pillowy texture will make every bite a treat!
