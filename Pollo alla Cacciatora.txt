Title: Pollo alla Cacciatora (Chicken Cacciatore) Recipe
Pollo alla Cacciatora, or Chicken Cacciatore, is a classic Italian dish that translates to "hunter-style chicken." It’s a rustic, flavorful stew made with chicken braised in a rich tomato sauce with garlic, onions, olives, and herbs. The dish is hearty and perfect for a cozy meal.

Ingredients:
Chicken - 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs or drumsticks (you can also use a whole chicken cut into pieces)
Olive oil - 2 tbsp
Onion- 1 large, sliced
Garlic - 3 cloves, minced
Carrot - 1, sliced (optional)
Celery - 1 stalk, sliced (optional)
Canned tomatoes - 400g (14 oz) crushed or whole (you can also use fresh, chopped tomatoes)
Red wine - 1/2 cup (optional)
Chicken broth - 1/2 cup (or water)
Black olives - 1/2 cup, pitted (green olives can also be used)
Capers - 2 tbsp (optional, for added tang)
Fresh rosemary - 1 sprig (or 1 tsp dried)
Fresh thyme - 2-3 sprigs (or 1 tsp dried)
Bay leaf - 1
Salt and pepper - to taste
Fresh parsley - chopped, for garnish

Instructions:
Brown the Chicken:

Heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then add them to the pan, skin-side down. Brown the chicken on both sides for 5-7 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove the chicken and set aside.
Sauté the Vegetables:

In the same pan, add the sliced onion, garlic, carrot, and celery (if using). Sauté for 5 minutes until the vegetables are softened.
Add the red wine (if using) and cook for another 2-3 minutes, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Add the Tomatoes and Simmer:

Add the canned tomatoes (crushed or chopped), chicken broth, olives, capers (if using), rosemary, thyme, and bay leaf. Stir to combine.
Return the browned chicken to the pan, skin-side up, and spoon some of the sauce over the chicken.
Braised Cooking:

Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let the chicken cook for 40-45 minutes, turning the chicken halfway through, until the chicken is cooked through and tender (internal temperature should reach 75°C/165°F).
Finish and Serve:

Remove the bay leaf and herb stems.
Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, or a pinch of sugar if the tomatoes are too acidic.
Garnish with fresh chopped parsley before serving.
Serve:
Pollo alla Cacciatora is typically served with polenta, mashed potatoes, pasta, or crusty bread to soak up the flavorful sauce.
