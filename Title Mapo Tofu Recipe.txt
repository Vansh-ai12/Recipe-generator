Title: Mapo Tofu Recipe
Mapo Tofu is a popular and spicy Sichuan dish featuring soft tofu in a rich, flavorful sauce made with ground pork or beef, fermented bean paste, chili paste, and Sichuan peppercorns. It’s a comforting and aromatic dish with a perfect balance of heat, savory flavors, and a numbing sensation from the Sichuan peppercorns.

Ingredients:
Tofu (silken or soft) – 400g (14 oz), cut into cubes
Ground pork (or beef) – 200g (7 oz)
Ginger – 1-inch piece, minced
Garlic – 3 cloves, minced
Green onions – 2 stalks, chopped (for garnish)
Sichuan peppercorns – 1 tsp, crushed (for the numbing flavor)
Douchi (fermented black beans) – 1 tbsp, chopped (optional but recommended)
Chili bean paste (doubanjiang) – 2 tbsp (or more for spice)
Soy sauce – 1 tbsp
Rice wine or Shaoxing wine – 1 tbsp
Chicken or vegetable stock – 1/2 cup
Cornstarch – 1 tbsp (mixed with 2 tbsp water to form a slurry)
Vegetable oil – 2 tbsp
Salt – to taste
Sugar – 1 tsp (to balance the heat)

Instructions:
1. Prepare the Tofu:
Cut the tofu into cubes and gently blanch it in boiling water for 1-2 minutes to firm it up. Drain and set aside. This helps the tofu hold its shape while cooking and prevents it from breaking down too much in the sauce.
2. Cook the Ground Meat:
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat.
Add the ground pork (or beef) and stir-fry until it starts to brown and is cooked through. Break up the meat into small pieces as it cooks.
3. Add Aromatics and Spices:
Add the minced garlic, ginger, and crushed Sichuan peppercorns to the wok. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
Stir in the chili bean paste (doubanjiang) and fermented black beans (douchi), cooking for another 1-2 minutes until the oil starts to turn red and fragrant.
4. Add Liquids and Tofu:
Add the rice wine (or Shaoxing wine), soy sauce, chicken stock, and sugar to the wok. Stir well to combine.
Gently add the tofu cubes to the wok, being careful not to break them up. Stir gently to coat the tofu in the sauce. Let it simmer for 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
5. Thicken the Sauce:
Stir in the cornstarch slurry (cornstarch mixed with water) and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy.
6. Garnish and Serve:
Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with more salt or chili paste if desired.
Garnish with chopped green onions and serve hot, ideally with steamed rice.
Serve:
Mapo Tofu is best enjoyed with a bowl of hot, steamed rice to soak up the flavorful sauce.
