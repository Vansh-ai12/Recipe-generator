Instructions:
Prepare the Vada Filling:

Heat oil in a pan, add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and curry leaves. Let them splutter.
Add chopped green chilies, ginger, and sauté for a minute.
Add turmeric powder, chili powder, and coriander powder. Stir well.
Add the mashed potatoes, salt, and lemon juice. Mix well, cook for 2-3 minutes.
Garnish with chopped coriander leaves. Let the mixture cool down, then form small balls (the vadas).
Prepare the Batter:

In a bowl, mix chickpea flour, rice flour, turmeric powder, chili powder, and salt.
Gradually add water to make a smooth, thick batter.
Fry the Vada:

Heat oil in a pan or wok for deep frying.
Dip each potato ball (vada) into the batter, coating it completely, and fry until golden and crispy, about 4-5 minutes.
Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
Assemble the Vada Pav:

Slit the pav (bread roll) horizontally but not all the way through.
Spread green chutney and tamarind chutney (if using) on the inside.
Place the fried vada in the pav and press gently.
Serve:
Serve the Vada Pav hot with extra chutney and fried green chilies on the side.
