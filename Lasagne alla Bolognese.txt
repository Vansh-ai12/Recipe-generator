Title: Lasagne alla Bolognese Recipe
Lasagne alla Bolognese is a classic Italian dish made with layers of fresh pasta, a rich Bolognese sauce (a slow-cooked meat sauce), and creamy béchamel sauce. It's a comforting and indulgent meal, perfect for special occasions or family dinners.

Ingredients:
For Bolognese Sauce:
Ground beef (or pork, or a mix) - 500g
Onion - 1, finely chopped
Carrot - 1, finely chopped
Celery - 1 stick, finely chopped
Garlic -2 cloves, minced
Tomato paste - 2 tbsp
Canned tomatoes - 400g, crushed or pureed
Red wine - 1/2 cup (optional but adds depth of flavor)
Milk - 1/2 cup (helps soften the acidity of tomatoes)
Olive oil - 2 tbsp
Salt and pepper - to taste
Fresh basil or oregano - 1 tsp (optional)
Bay leaf - 1
For Béchamel Sauce:
Butter - 2 tbsp
All-purpose flour - 2 tbsp
Milk - 2 cups
Salt- to taste
Nutmeg - a pinch (optional)
Parmesan cheese - 1/4 cup, grated (optional for extra richness)
For Assembling:
Fresh lasagna sheets - 9-12 (depending on the size of the baking dish)
Mozzarella cheese - 200g, grated
Parmesan cheese - 1/2 cup, grated

Instructions:
1. Make the Bolognese Sauce:
Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onions, carrots, celery, and garlic. Sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
Add the ground meat and cook until browned, breaking it up into smaller pieces with a spoon.
Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes.
Add canned tomatoes, red wine, milk, salt, pepper, and a bay leaf. Bring to a simmer.
Lower the heat and simmer gently for 1-1.5 hours, stirring occasionally. If the sauce gets too thick, add a bit of water or broth.
Remove the bay leaf and adjust seasoning as needed.
2. Make the Béchamel Sauce:
In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly to form a smooth roux.
Gradually add the milk while whisking to avoid lumps. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens (about 5-7 minutes).
Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.
Stir in grated Parmesan cheese (optional) for extra richness.
3. Assemble the Lasagne:
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
Boil the lasagna sheets in salted water according to package instructions (if using dried sheets). If using fresh pasta, no boiling is needed. Drain and lay them flat on a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.
In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of Bolognese sauce on the bottom.
Place a layer of lasagna sheets over the sauce. Top with a portion of Bolognese sauce, followed by a generous spoonful of béchamel sauce.
Sprinkle with grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
Repeat the layers (pasta, Bolognese, béchamel, cheeses) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a top layer of pasta, Bolognese sauce, and cheeses.
4. Bake:
Cover the lasagna with foil and bake for 25 minutes.
Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbling.
Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
Serve:
Slice and serve hot, garnished with extra Parmesan if desired. Enjoy with a side of salad and garlic bread!
