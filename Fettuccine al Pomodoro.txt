Title: Fettuccine al Pomodoro Recipe
Fettuccine al Pomodoro is a simple, classic Italian pasta dish featuring fettuccine (wide, flat pasta) tossed in a fresh, flavorful tomato sauce made with ripe tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and fresh basil. It's a light, yet satisfying dish, perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or a special occasion.

Ingredients:
Fettuccine pasta - 250g (fresh or dried)
Tomatoes- 4-5 ripe, chopped (or 1 can of crushed tomatoes)
Garlic - 2 cloves, minced
Olive oil - 2 tbsp
Fresh basil leaves - 1/4 cup, torn or chopped
Parmesan cheese - 1/4 cup, grated (optional)
Salt - to taste
Black pepper - to taste
Sugar - 1/2 tsp (optional, to balance acidity)
Red pepper flakes - a pinch (optional, for heat)

Instructions:
Cook the Fettuccine:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook according to package instructions (usually 8-10 minutes) until al dente.
Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.
Make the Pomodoro Sauce:

While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant and golden (be careful not to burn).
Add the chopped tomatoes (or canned tomatoes) to the pan. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar (if the tomatoes are too acidic). Cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down and form a slightly thickened sauce.
If you like a smoother sauce, you can use a spoon to mash the tomatoes as they cook, or use an immersion blender for a more refined texture.
Combine Pasta and Sauce:

Add the cooked fettuccine directly into the pan with the pomodoro sauce. Toss gently to coat the pasta with the sauce. If needed, add a little reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce and help it stick to the noodles.
Finish the Dish:

Stir in the torn basil leaves and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
Adjust seasoning with extra salt and pepper if needed.
Serve:

Plate the pasta and garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese (if using) and extra basil leaves.
Serve hot and enjoy!
Serve:
Fettuccine al Pomodoro pairs wonderfully with a light salad and a glass of white wine. It’s a simple yet delicious dish that showcases the freshness of tomatoes and the richness of olive oil.
