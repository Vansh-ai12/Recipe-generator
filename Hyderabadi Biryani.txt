Ghee/Oil - 2 tbsp
Saffron strands - a few (soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk)

Mint leaves - for garnish (optional)


Instructions:
Marinate the Meat:

Mix chicken or mutton with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, coriander powder, lemon juice, mint, cilantro, and salt. Marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for better flavor).
Cook the Rice:

Wash and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes.
Boil water in a large pot with bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it's 70-80% done (parboil). Drain the water and set the rice aside.
Fry the Onions:

Heat ghee or oil in a pan. Fry the sliced onions until golden and crispy. Set aside for garnish.
Layer the Biryani:

In a large pot, heat a little ghee or oil. Add the marinated meat and cook for 5-7 minutes.
Add a layer of partially cooked rice on top of the meat. Drizzle saffron milk over the rice and add some fried onions and mint leaves.
Cook the Biryani:

Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes (you can place a heavy pan or tawa under the pot to avoid direct heat).
Alternatively, you can cook it in the dum style by sealing the pot with dough and slow-cooking.
Serve:

Gently fluff the biryani and serve hot, garnished with fried onions and mint.
